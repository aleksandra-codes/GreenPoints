# Welcome to Green Points!
COMP 1930 course project

This is a website that rewards people for recycling. We are trying to tackle 
increasing problem of the landfields filling up with recyclable plastics.

This project contains HTML, CSS and Java Script files. We used firebase for user
authentication and to store user information, such as current points.
